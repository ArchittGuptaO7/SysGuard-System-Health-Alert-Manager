# SysGuard-System-Health-Alert-Manager
SysGuard is a Unix-based system monitoring project for lab assessment. It tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage, generates color-coded reports, and alerts via email when memory exceeds limits. The tool offers a menu-driven interface to view system stats, top/bottom usage, and manage reports efficiently.
